Maria Ahmed is a PhD student in the Sociology program at Western University under the supervision of Dr. Kim Shuey. Her interests are rooted in population health and public policy. With a focus on structural inequalities and life course theory, Maria’s SSHRC-funded doctoral research aims to examine policymaking within highly institutionalized settings in times of crises (such as the COVID-19 pandemic) and the impacts of public policies on disadvantaged populations. Maria completed her undergraduate degree in Commerce at Queen’s University with a focus on organizational behaviour and her master’s degree in Leadership & Policy at the University of Toronto. 

Maria is adept at using Stata and R to perform quantitative data analysis and uses logistical regression modelling and regression discontinuity analysis for her dissertation research. She also brings with her a wealth of knowledge on qualitative research methods, such as interviews and ethnographic research. As a Graduate Teaching Assistant, Maria has supported following courses to date: Sociology of Healthcare; Thinking Sociologically; Gender and Society; Statistics for Sociology; and Qualitative Research Methods.

Maria has a passion for data visualization and making complex concepts accessible to the general public. Her goal upon graduation is to work in the federal research sector examining health inequities and public policies.
